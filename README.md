# Project: Predicting Heart Disease with Supervised Learning
## Introduction
The WHO has announced that cardiovascular diseases are responsible for the most deaths throughout the world. There are seventeen million people who die from it every year, especially heart disease. Prevention is better than cure; if we can evaluate the risk of everybody, not just potential patients, who show a likelihood of heart disease, we can prevent the disease from developing. This dataset contains real data, including important features of patients.

In this project, we employ several supervised learning algorithms trained on a dataset containing important features of real patients to accurately model individuals' heart conditions. We then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data.

Our goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual has heart disease.
